**# Python Calculator: A Powerful and User-Friendly Tool**

This Python code implements a versatile calculator class `Calc` that provides essential arithmetic operations for numbers. It's designed to be clear, efficient, and easy to use.

**## Features**

- **Performs basic arithmetic:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Handles floating-point numbers:** Accommodates calculations with decimals.
- **Well-structured and readable code:** Follows best practices for maintainability.

**## Installation**

There's no installation required for this code. You can simply copy and paste it into a Python script or interactive interpreter (like IDLE or a Jupyter Notebook) to start using it.

**## Usage**

1. **Import the `Calc` class:**
   ```python
   from your_script_name import Calc
   ```

2. **Create an instance of the `Calc` class:**
   ```python
   calculator = Calc(num1, num2)  # Replace num1 and num2 with your desired values
   ```

3. **Perform calculations using the class methods:**
   ```python
   result_add = calculator.add()
   result_subtract = calculator.substract()
   result_multiply = calculator.multiply()
   result_divide = calculator.divide()
   ```

**## Example**

```python
from your_script_name import Calc

calculator = Calc(5.2, 3.1)

add_result = calculator.add()
print("Addition:", add_result)  # Output: Addition: 8.3

subtract_result = calculator.substract()
print("Subtraction:", subtract_result)  # Output: Subtraction: 2.1

multiply_result = calculator.multiply()
print("Multiplication:", multiply_result)  # Output: Multiplication: 16.12

divide_result = calculator.divide()
print("Division:", divide_result)  # Output: Division: 1.6774193548387096
```
